## Purpose
The goal of this strategy is to help young people (students and early career earners) make smart choices with their money, by splitting income into essential categories and future-focused investments.

## The Core Idea – “Buckets” for Your Money
Your money is divided into **buckets**, each with a purpose:

1. **Fixed Expenses** – Everyday living costs like rent, food, and transport.
2. **Emergency Fund** – Savings for unexpected events (aim for 6 months of expenses).
3. **Big Goal** *(optional)* – A large purchase or savings target (e.g., laptop, trip, car).
4. **Core Investments** – Low-risk, long-term investments like index funds (ETFs: VAS/VGS).
5. **Satellite Investments** – Higher-risk opportunities, such as Bitcoin ETFs (small % only).
6. **Flexible Spending** – Fun money for non-essential spending.

## Default Allocation Percentages
These are a starting point and can be adjusted:

- **Fixed Expenses:** Based on your actual living costs  
- **Emergency Fund:** Until you reach your target, around **20–30%** of leftover income  
- **Core Investments:** **10%** of leftover income  
- **Satellite Investments:** **3%** of leftover income  
- **Flexible Spending:** Whatever remains after the above allocations

## Why This Works
- **Balance:** Covers needs, wants, and future goals.
- **Safety Net:** Emergency fund protects you from debt.
- **Growth:** Core investments build wealth over time.
- **Opportunity:** Satellite investments let you take small, calculated risks.
- **Freedom:** Flexible spending means you still enjoy life now.
